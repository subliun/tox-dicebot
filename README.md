This is a bot for tox groupchats. It does very little, and is very bloated. 
I'm so sorry for this code.

# Installation
Installation is fairly simple. This bot will only work on Linux. 

1. Install rust:
`curl -s https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh`
2. Make with `cargo build`
3. Run with `./target/dice_bot`
4. Re-evaluate your life and question why you downloaded this bot.
